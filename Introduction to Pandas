---------------------- Introduction to Pandas Data Structures -----------------

Pandas introduces addition Data Structres to Python, these are based on numpy and can hence be passed to numpy functions such as np.square
1. Series : Series takes a list as it's input and put a label on each of the value, by default the labels are 0, 1, ..... len(list) - 1. An optional argument can be given which is a list that defines a label for each value in the first list.
for ex-:
s = pd.Series([7, 'Heisenberg', 3.14, -1789710578, 'Happy Eating!'])
print(s)
would simply print
0                7
1       Heisenberg
2             3.14
3      -1789710578
4    Happy Eating!
dtype: object

however 
s = pd.Series([7, 'Heisenberg', 3.14, -1789710578, 'Happy Eating!'],
              index=['A', 'Z', 'C', 'Y', 'E'])
print(s)
would print
A                7
Z       Heisenberg
C             3.14
Y      -1789710578
E    Happy Eating!
dtype: object

The Series constructor can convert a dictonary as well, using the keys of the dictionary as its index.

d = {'Chicago': 1000, 'New York': 1300, 'Portland': 900, 'San Francisco': 1100,
     'Austin': 450, 'Boston': None}
cities = pd.Series(d)
cities
Austin            450
Boston            NaN
Chicago          1000
New York         1300
Portland          900
San Francisco    1100
dtype: float64
You can use the index to select specific items from the Series ...

cities['Chicago']
1000.0
cities[['Chicago', 'Portland', 'San Francisco']]
Chicago          1000
Portland          900
San Francisco    1100
dtype: float64
Or you can use boolean indexing for selection.

cities[cities < 1000]
Austin      450
Portland    900
dtype: float64
That last one might be a little weird, so let's make it more clear - cities < 1000 returns a Series of True/False values, which we then pass to our Series cities, returning the corresponding True items.

less_than_1000 = cities < 1000
print(less_than_1000)
print('\n')
print(cities[less_than_1000])
Austin            True
Boston           False
Chicago          False
New York         False
Portland          True
San Francisco    False
dtype: bool


Austin      450
Portland    900
dtype: float64
You can also change the values in a Series on the fly.

# changing based on the index
print('Old value:', cities['Chicago'])
cities['Chicago'] = 1400
print('New value:', cities['Chicago'])
('Old value:', 1000.0)
('New value:', 1400.0)
# changing values using boolean logic
print(cities[cities < 1000])
print('\n')
cities[cities < 1000] = 750

print cities[cities < 1000]
Austin      450
Portland    900
dtype: float64


Austin      750
Portland    750
dtype: float64
What if you aren't sure whether an item is in the Series? You can check using idiomatic Python.

print('Seattle' in cities)
print('San Francisco' in cities)
False
True
Mathematical operations can be done using scalars and functions.

# divide city values by 3
cities / 3
Austin           250.000000
Boston                  NaN
Chicago          466.666667
New York         433.333333
Portland         250.000000
San Francisco    366.666667
dtype: float64
# square city values
np.square(cities)
Austin            562500
Boston               NaN
Chicago          1960000
New York         1690000
Portland          562500
San Francisco    1210000
dtype: float64
You can add two Series together, which returns a union of the two Series with the addition occurring on the shared index values. Values on either Series that did not have a shared index will produce a NULL/NaN (not a number).

print(cities[['Chicago', 'New York', 'Portland']])
print('\n')
print(cities[['Austin', 'New York']])
print('\n')
print(cities[['Chicago', 'New York', 'Portland']] + cities[['Austin', 'New York']])
Chicago     1400
New York    1300
Portland     750
dtype: float64


Austin       750
New York    1300
dtype: float64


Austin       NaN
Chicago      NaN
New York    2600
Portland     NaN
dtype: float64
Notice that because Austin, Chicago, and Portland were not found in both Series, they were returned with NULL/NaN values.

NULL checking can be performed with isnull and notnull.

# returns a boolean series indicating which values aren't NULL
cities.notnull()
Austin            True
Boston           False
Chicago           True
New York          True
Portland          True
San Francisco     True
dtype: bool
# use boolean logic to grab the NULL cities
print(cities.isnull())
print('\n')
print(cities[cities.isnull()])
Austin           False
Boston            True
Chicago          False
New York         False
Portland         False
San Francisco    False
dtype: bool


Boston   NaN
dtype: float64


2. DataFrame
A DataFrame is a tabular representation of data just like as done in Excel or SQL. Use pandas.DataFrame function for this. The input to DataFrame is a dictionary, this Dictionary contains name of columns of the table as keys and value of each key is a list, this list contains the values in each row for that column, any missing value is displayed as NaN.
By default the columns will be sorted alphabatically, however we can specify the order by an optional argument, this optional argument is a list that contains the name of the columns to be displayed in that order. If a wrong column name will be used than it will be treated as column with all missing values and thus the all values for this column will be NaN.
We can access all the values under a column with dictionary like syntax. An example to understand all of these.


data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
        'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions', 'Lions', 'Lions'],
        'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
        'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}

football = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['year', 'team', 'wins', 'losses'])
football

	year	team	wins	losses
0	2010	Bears	11	5
1	2011	Bears	8	8
2	2012	Bears	10	6
3	2011	Packers	15	1
4	2012	Packers	11	5
5	2010	Lions	6	10
6	2011	Lions	10	6
7	2012	Lions	4	12

to access all the values under 'team' we can do
football['team']

0      Bears
1      Bears
2      Bears
3    Packers
4    Packers
5      Lions
6      LionsQ
7      Lions
Name: team, dtype: object


Above we see that index are choosen starting from 0, 1, 2, .... . We can specify to choose a different index just like as we can do in Series.
data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
        'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions', 'Lions', 'Lions'],
        'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
        'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}

football = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['year', 'team', 'wins', 'losses'], index=['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five','six', 'seven'
                                                                                , 'eight'])
football

	year	team	wins	losses
one	2010	Bears	11	5
two	2011	Bears	8	8
three	2012	Bears	10	6
four	2011	Packers	15	1
five	2012	Packers	11	5
six	2010	Lions	6	10
seven	2011	Lions	10	6
eight	2012	Lions	4	12

Now in order to select a particular row(or tuple as we say in SQL) we can do the same thing as in Series
football.loc['one']
and the output is
year       2010
team      Bears
wins         11
losses        5
Name: one, dtype: object


** read_csv function
This is used for reading a comma separated file and returns a dataframe object and can thus display csv into a nice tabular format.

the basic syntax is:-
pandas.read_csv('full_csv_file_path.csv')

we can provide additional options like:-
deliminator:- if the data is not separated by csv but by some other character.
skip:- specify the number of rows to skip, some times we include metadata at the top along with the csv data, by default read_csv will interpret it as column name, we thus want to skip the rows contatining the metadata
header=None :- if csv contains no header(column names) and just data, by default the first row is inferred as column names, header if set to None, choses integer index starting from 0 to column - 1.
names :- [#names here]:- if header set to none than specify your own column names. 
nrows :- read only the specified number of rows.

---> The describe method:
	calling the describe method on the dataframe returned from the read_csv function can be used to see the summary of the data. It provides for each column fields like count, mean, standard deviation, max, min, 25%, 50% and 75% percentile. The 25%, 50%, and 75% rows show the corresponding
percentiles: a percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group
of observations falls.

----> the info method:
	The info() method is useful to get a quick description of the data, in particular the total number of rows,
and each attribute’s type and number of non-null values.

----> dataFrame.iloc[]
Pandas provides a suite of methods in order to get purely integer based indexing. The semantics follow closely python and numpy slicing. These are 0-based indexing. When slicing, the start bounds is included, while the upper bound is excluded. Trying to use a non-integer, even a valid label will raise an IndexError.

The .iloc attribute is the primary access method. The following are valid inputs:

An integer e.g. 5
A list or array of integers [4, 3, 0]
A slice object with ints 1:7
A boolean array
A callable,

for ex:-

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('FL_insurance_sample.csv', nrows=10)

now all of these are legal:
df.iloc[0:11]
df.iloc[2]
df.iloc[[2,5,7]]

************ More on loc, iloc and the difference between them ********************
1. We can use both loc and iloc to specify both the rows as well as the columns to select.
The syntax is :-
df.loc[# specify rows here, # specify columns here]

now there can be various ways to specify rows and columns. These ways will also change depending on whether we are choosing iloc or loc.

2. loc is used for choosing by labels.
in: 
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('infinity_stone.csv')
df

out:
	Name 			Place 			Appeared in
0	Space Stone		Asgard/With Loki	Capatain America - First Avenger
1	Reality Stone		With Collector		Thor 1
2	Power Stone		Xandar/With Nova Cops	Gaurdians of the Galaxy Vol 1
3	Mind Stone		Earth/With Vision	Avengers : Age of Ultron
4	Time Stone		Earth/With Dr. Strange	Doctor Strange 1
5 	Soul Stone		Earth/Wakanda		Black Panther 1

in:
df.loc[0, 'Name']
out:
Space Stone

in:
df.loc[[0,2,5], ['Name', 'Place']]
	Name 			Place 
0	Space Stone		Asgard/With Loki
2	Power Stone		Xandar/With Nova Cops
5 	Soul Stone		Earth/Wakanda

in:
df.loc[:, :]

out:
	Name 			Place 			Appeared in
0	Space Stone		Asgard/With Loki	Capatain America - First Avenger
1	Reality Stone		With Collector		Thor 1
2	Power Stone		Xandar/With Nova Cops	Gaurdians of the Galaxy Vol 1
3	Mind Stone		Earth/With Vision	Avengers : Age of Ultron
4	Time Stone		Earth/With Dr. Strange	Doctor Strange 1
5 	Soul Stone		Earth/Wakanda		Black Panther 1

in:
df.loc[0:2, :'Appearde in']
out:
	Name 			Place 			Appeared in
0	Space Stone		Asgard/With Loki	Capatain America - First Avenger
1	Reality Stone		With Collector		Thor 1
2	Power Stone		Xandar/With Nova Cops	Gaurdians of the Galaxy Vol 1

-----> So, to summerise:
1. loc is based on labels, it will raise an exception 'Key Not Found' if wrong label is asked to query
2. Unlike Python list the upper limit is not exclusive ie df.loc[start:end] will fetch result inclusive of both start as well as end.
3. If either column or row is not specified then loc will return all rows/columns(whatever is not specified). This holds true for iloc as well
4. We can choose to specify only rows with a syntax like this:- df.loc[#list or label] and loc will implicitly assume that it has to return all columns but only the specified rows. Again this holds true for iloc as well(with a minor difference in how the rows are specified).
5. Ultimately we can also pass a Boolean Array to both loc and iloc. Each value in the boolean array tells if the row or column with that index number be included in the result or not. If len(boolean_array) < total_rows/total_columns then all the indices in the range len(boolean_array).....total_rows/total_columns are implicitly assumed to be false.
For ex:-
in:
df.loc[[True, True, False], [True]]
out:
	Name
0	Space Stone
1	Reality Stone

------> iloc is based on indices:
To illustrate the differences between the three methods, consider the following Series:

>>> s = pd.Series(np.nan, index=[49,48,47,46,45, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
>>> s
49   NaN
48   NaN
47   NaN
46   NaN
45   NaN
1    NaN
2    NaN
3    NaN
4    NaN
5    NaN
Then s.iloc[:3] returns the first 3 rows (since it looks at the position) and s.loc[:3] returns the first 8 rows (since it looks at the labels):

>>> s.iloc[:3] # slice the first three rows
49   NaN
48   NaN
47   NaN

>>> s.loc[:3] # slice up to and including label 3
49   NaN
48   NaN
47   NaN
46   NaN
45   NaN
1    NaN
2    NaN
3    NaN

-------------------------> Note : Many operations can be applied directly on the DataFrame object to get the same result instead of using iloc and loc but the syntax can be hard to remember. For ex:-

in:
df[['Name', 'Place']]

out:
	Name 			Place
0	Space Stone		Asgard/With Loki
1	Reality Stone		With Collector
2	Power Stone		Xandar/With Nova Cops
3	Mind Stone		Earth/With Vision
4	Time Stone		Earth/With Dr. Strange
5 	Soul Stone		Earth/Wakanda

in
df[0:6] # is index based and works on rows, i.e. it is similar to iloc with row indices

out:
	Name 			Place 			Appeared in
0	Space Stone		Asgard/With Loki	Capatain America - First Avenger
1	Reality Stone		With Collector		Thor 1
2	Power Stone		Xandar/With Nova Cops	Gaurdians of the Galaxy Vol 1
3	Mind Stone		Earth/With Vision	Avengers : Age of Ultron
4	Time Stone		Earth/With Dr. Strange	Doctor Strange 1
5 	Soul Stone		Earth/Wakanda		Black Panther 1


********* map, apply and applymap

1. map
-----> Map values of Series using input correspondence (which can be a dict, Series, or function)

Parameters:	
arg : function, dict, or Series

na_action : {None, ‘ignore’}

If ‘ignore’, propagate NA values, without passing them to the mapping function

Returns:	
y : Series

same index as caller


--------> using map with x.map(y), x and y both are series. In this case it maps the output(value against index of each row) of x with the input(index of each row) of y. If the input of x is not same as y or if the size of input of x is not same as that of size of y then NaN is returned in all rows, number of rows returned always equals to number of rows in the calling Series. For example:-

in:
x = pd.Series([1,2,3,4], index=['Dr Strange', 'Wanda Maximof', 'Vision', 'Ironman'])
y = pd.Series(['Dr Strange', 'Wanda Maximof', 'Vision', 'Ironman'], index=[1,2,3,4])
x.map(y)

out:
Dr Strange          Dr Strange
Wanda Maximof    Wanda Maximof
Vision                  Vision
Ironman                Ironman

---------> using Series.map(dictionary), the values of Series are replaced by key-value pair specified in the dictionary, if a value in the Series is missing as a Key in the dictionary then NULL is set against it. ex-:


in:
import pandas as pd
train = pd.read_csv('http://bit.ly/kaggletrain')
train.head()

out:

PassengerId	Survived	Pclass	Name	Sex	Age	SibSp	Parch	Ticket	Fare	Cabin	Embarked
0	1	0	3	Braund, Mr. Owen Harris	male	22.0	1	0	A/5 21171	7.2500	NaN	S

3	4	1	1	Futrelle, Mrs. Jacques Heath (Lily May Peel)	female	35.0	1	0	113803	53.1000	C123	S
4	5	0	3	Allen, Mr. William Henry	male	35.0	0	0	373450	8.0500	NaN	S


in:
train['Sex_num'] = train.Sex.map({'female' : 0, 'male' : 1}) # train['Sex_num'] will introduce a new column(all columns are basically Series) in the 									Dataframe, A DF is thus a collection of Series.
train.loc[0:4, ['Sex', 'Sex_num']]

out:
	Sex	Sex_num
0	male	1
1	female	0
2	female	0
3	female	0
4	male	1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. apply:
apply applies a function on a Series or a DataFrame and the ouptut is also a Series or DataFrame which is the result of application of function on each element of the Series/DataFrame.
If applied to DataFrame we can also specify the axis(ie row or column, 0 denotes row(ie result will be column based, see example below for more clarification)) the function on. 


---> apply on Series
in:
train['Name_length'] = train.Name.apply(len)
train.loc[0:4, ['Name', 'Name_length']]

out:

	Name						Name_length
